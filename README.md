# OS-HW3
This is the homework 3 from Nguyen Huu Tam Ton.

**Objective:**
- The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the principles of memory management and walk you through the development of a program that uses a page/frame table to convert logical addresses to physical addresses.

**Intructions:**
I have given specific instructions in the **Instruction.txt** file. Please read carefully to understand how to run the program.

**Sample Usage**
Suppose you want to translate the logical addresses 0x3A7F, 0xABCD, and 0x5678 to physical addresses:
Enter logical addresses (ex: 0x3A7F) (enter 'q' to quit):
> 0x3A7F
Logical Address: 0x3A7F => Page Number: 0x0D, Offset: 0x7F
> 0xABCD
Logical Address: 0xABCD => Page Number: 0x2B, Offset: 0xCD
> 0x5678
Logical Address: 0x5678 => Page Number: 0x15, Offset: 0x78
> q

**Thanks for reading carefully and for the details, please look carefully at file _Description.txt_ and _Instruction.txt_**
