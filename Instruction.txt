Instruction:
----------------

To run this program, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open a C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, etc.).
2. Create a new file and copy the entire provided source code into that file.
3. Save the file with the extension ".cpp" (e.g., "main.cpp").
4. Compile and run your program.

Moreover, You can use the following command to compile
the program in a Unix/Linux or macOS environment:
=>     g++ -o main main.cpp

Then, run the program by typing:
=>     ./main

>> But remember to carefully check the path in cmd to run correctly.

Compiling and running your program may be done
with the built-in tools of an integrated development
environment such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, etc...

INPUT:
- You will notice a screen requesting you to
input logical addresses after starting the software.

- Input the logical addresses (such as 0x3A7F)
using hexadecimal notation.

- The prompt "Enter logical addresses (ex: 0x3A7F) (enter 'q' to quit):" appears
when the application runs.

- Here, you can enter the logical addresses that are needed in
hexadecimal notation, such as "0xABCD". Details regarding this
location, such as the offset and page number, will be shown
by the application. Simply type 'q' or 'Q' to end the application.

---
OUTPUT:
- The page/frame table will be used by the software to convert
each logical address to a physical address.

After that, for each logical address input, it will display the
matching page number and offset.
