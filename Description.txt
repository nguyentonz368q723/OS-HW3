Description
------------

- This assignment focuses on implementing memory management concepts,
specifically translating logical addresses to physical
addresses using a page/frame table.

- In simpler terms, imagine I have a computer's memory
represented as a set of pages and frames.
The program I'll write will handle converting addresses
used by the computer into actual physical locations in memory.

- To do this, I'll create a table that maps logical page
numbers to physical frame numbers. When the program receives
a logical address, it will use this table to figure out
where in memory that address corresponds to.

- For example, if the program receives the logical
address "0x3A7F", it will translate it to a physical
address and then provide the corresponding
page number and offset.
